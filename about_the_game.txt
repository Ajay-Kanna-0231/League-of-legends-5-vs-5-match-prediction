League of Legends (LoL) is a multiplayer online battle arena (MOBA) video game developed and published by Riot Games. Players assume the role of a "champion" with unique abilities, and they team up with other players to compete against an opposing team. The goal is to destroy the opposing team's Nexus, a structure located at the heart of their base, after overcoming a series of defensive structures.

Champions
League of Legends features over 150 champions, each with unique abilities and playstyles. Champions are divided into several classes based on their abilities and roles in the game:

1. Tank: Durable champions that can absorb a lot of damage.
2. Mage: Champions that use magic-based attacks, typically from a distance.
3. Assassin: Champions that specialize in quickly eliminating opponents.
4. Marksman: Ranged champions that deal consistent damage over time.
5. Support: Champions that aid their team through healing, buffs, or crowd control.
6. Fighter: Versatile champions that can deal and take moderate amounts of damage.

Ranked Play
Players can participate in ranked games to earn competitive rankings. The ranked hierarchy in League of Legends is as follows, from lowest to highest:

1. Iron
2. Bronze
3. Silver
4. Gold
5. Platinum
6. Emerald
7. Diamond
8. Master
9. Grandmaster
10. Challenger

Each tier, except for Master, Grandmaster, and Challenger, is divided into four divisions (e.g., Silver IV, Silver III, Silver II, Silver I), with IV being the lowest and I being the highest within the tier.

Gameplay and Teams
The game consists of 10 players divided into two teams: the red team and the blue team. Each player selects a champion to play, and each champion gains experience and levels up throughout the match, increasing their power and abilities.
