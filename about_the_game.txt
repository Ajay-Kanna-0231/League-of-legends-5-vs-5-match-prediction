League of Legends (LoL) is a multiplayer online battle arena (MOBA) video game developed and published by Riot Games. Players assume the role of a "champion" with unique abilities, and they team up with other players to compete against an opposing team. The goal is to destroy the opposing team's Nexus, a structure located at the heart of their base, after overcoming a series of defensive structures.

### Champions
League of Legends features over 150 champions, each with unique abilities and playstyles. Champions are divided into several classes based on their abilities and roles in the game:

1. **Tank**: Durable champions that can absorb a lot of damage.
2. **Mage**: Champions that use magic-based attacks, typically from a distance.
3. **Assassin**: Champions that specialize in quickly eliminating opponents.
4. **Marksman**: Ranged champions that deal consistent damage over time.
5. **Support**: Champions that aid their team through healing, buffs, or crowd control.
6. **Fighter**: Versatile champions that can deal and take moderate amounts of damage.

### Ranked Play
Players can participate in ranked games to earn competitive rankings. The ranked hierarchy in League of Legends is as follows, from lowest to highest:

1. **Iron**
2. **Bronze**
3. **Silver**
4. **Gold**
5. **Platinum**
6. **Diamond**
7. **Master**
8. **Grandmaster**
9. **Challenger**

Each tier, except for Master, Grandmaster, and Challenger, is divided into four divisions (e.g., Silver IV, Silver III, Silver II, Silver I), with IV being the lowest and I being the highest within the tier.

### Features Used in the Model
The model uses various features extracted from match data to predict the outcome of games. Some of these features include:

- **Kills, Deaths, and Assists (KDA)**: The number of kills, deaths, and assists each team has.
- **Champion Class Distribution**: The number of each class of champions on each team.
- **Rank Scores**: The average rank score of the players on each team.
- **Objective Control**: Metrics related to control over objectives such as towers and dragons.

This detailed information helps the model to understand the dynamics of the game and make accurate predictions.
